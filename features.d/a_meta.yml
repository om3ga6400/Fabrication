config_screen:
	name: Config Screen
	meta: true
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/config_screen.mp4
	desc:
		Fabrication has a nice ingame configuration GUI accessed via Mod Menu on Fabric or the
		built-in Mods screen on Forge. It can be used to toggle all features.

		The GUI is client/server aware (note Fabrication does not currently have config syncing
		outside of the GUI) and can be used to view the server's config, or even change it if you're
		an op.

config_command:
	name: Config Command
	meta: true
	desc:
		The /fabrication command has a "config" subcommand that can be used to reload config files,
		set config keys, and get config keys. This is useful from command blocks (used extensively
		in the demo videos), from non-Fabrication clients, or from Forge clients (no ingame Mods
		button in 1.16)

block_distribution_analysis:
	name: Block Distribution Analysis
	meta: true
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/block_distribution_analysis.png
	desc:
		The /fabrication command has an "analyze" subcommand that can be used to perform block
		distribution analysis on the world. By default it will scan the dimension you're in, but
		you can specify an alternate dimension if you want. A biome filter can also be specified.

		This will generate and/or load a ton of chunks. Use with caution. Progress reports go to
		the console; once complete, a TSV (tab-separated value) file will be written to the game
		directory.

atlas_viewer:
	name: Atlas Viewer
	meta: true
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/atlas_viewer.png
	desc:
		The /fabrication:client command has an "atlas" subcommand
		that can be used to view any of the loaded texture atlases.
		Information on sprites will be shown when hovered.

		This is an invaluable debugging tool for various kinds of atlas disasters, and was added to
		debug a sprite overwrite issue with Old Lava.

		- Added no_dinnerlava
		- Added oak_is_apple.
